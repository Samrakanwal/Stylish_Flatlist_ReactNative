This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.



## Step 3: Project Flatlist App

create a React Native application that meets all the specified requirements using Redux for state management and Axios for fetching data from an API. I'll use a fake API endpoint for demonstration purposes, ensuring we handle large lists efficiently with FlatList and implementing necessary error handling.

### Project Setup
Make sure you have Node.js installed and set up a new React Native project using React Native ClI for quick setup:

### Install Necessary Packages
 need Redux for state management, React Redux for React bindings, Redux Toolkit for simplifying Redux setup, and Axios for HTTP requests:

### Configure Redux Store
Create a store.js in the root of  project:

### Create Redux State Slice
Set up  redux/postreducer.js:


### Create the component 
This component fetches posts and displays them using FlatList:

### Update App.js
Include the Redux provider:


## Conclusion
This setup uses Redux for state management, Axios for data fetching, and a FlatList for rendering large lists efficiently. The key benefits of this approach include centralized state management, effective handling of asynchronous operations, and efficient list rendering in mobile applications. This architecture makes the app scalable and responsive.
